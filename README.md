# Chakra Cross Compatibility Layer

Provides a compatibility layer for Chakra UI components across V2 and V3 versions, allowing developers to use a consistent API regardless of the Chakra UI version.

Components will follow coding practices and API conventions of Chakra UI V3, while maintaining compatibility with V2.

**Note:** This is not intended to be run in a local project, rather it is meant to be used in external libraries that need to support both Chakra UI V2 and V3.
